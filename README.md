Advent of Code 2020
====================

My year 2020 solutions for [ Advent of Code ](https://adventofcode.com/2020). 

This year I will try Python as language,
first because it is simple and has a lot of "batteries included" for number-crunching tasks, 2nd because my
Python skills are somewhat rusty.

## Diary

### Day Zero - Setup

Today I just set up my env, did a proof-of-concept implementation ([ Puzzle #1 from last year ](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/1)),
and organized my files.

First outcome: a lib with:

* `fn measure(Function)`: executes the given function and returns its time needed to run
* `fn readfile(file, sep)`: reads a file, returns a list with its lines, or a split version of a line.
